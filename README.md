# NanoClaw Student Assistant

A personal AI agent system for university students, built on [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) and integrated with the [ChatCSE](https://github.com/vinamra/ChatCSE) Virtual TA.

Each student gets their own NanoClaw agent instance, accessible via Discord DM, that serves as a unified interface to all their academic tools and resources.

## Architecture
